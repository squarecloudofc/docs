## How to Host My Archive on Square Cloud?
<Steps>
  <Step 
  
  title="Initial Setup" icon="file">
    The first step to host your asset on **Square Cloud** is to upload your file into the [put endpoint](/blob-reference/endpoint/put). This endpoint allows you to upload your file to the serverless storage.    
  </Step>
  <Step 
  
  title="Access URL" icon="globe">
    The second step is to access your file through the URL provided by the response of the previous step. This URL is the public link to your file, and you can use it to access your asset from anywhere.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Benchmarks

We've conducted extensive benchmarks to ensure that **Square Cloud** is the fastest and most reliable serverless storage solution. Here are some of the key findings from our benchmarks:

- **Latency**: The average latency for receiving a file is ~20ms.
- **Throughput**: The average throughput for a file is ~10-15Mybtes/s. (80-120mbps)
- **Availability**: The average availability is 99.999999999% (11 9's). (powered by a S3 Design)

In Square Cloud tests, using our infrastructure, in [Tampa, Florida](/platform/overview#our-secure-infrastructure).<br/>
Latency is lower than 20ms, and throughput is higher than ~100MB/s.

In a expountaneous test, using a famous website testing tool ([check-host](https://check-host.net/check-report/16a4d450kafe)), we tested the latency of our serverless storage in 10 different locations.

| Location [16a4d450kafe] | Latency (ms) |
|-------------------------|--------------|
| USA, Chicago			  | 30		     |
| Netherlands, Amsterdam  | 32	  		 |
| Germany, Frankfurt	  | 32		 	 |
| France, Paris			  | 32			 |
| USA, Atlanta			  | 32			 |
| UK, Coventry			  | 44	 		 |
| Poland, Poznan		  | 49			 |
| Brazil, Sao Paulo		  | 42			 |
| Croatia, Sisak		  | 55	 		 |
| Spain, Barcelona		  | 59			 |

Using higher file sizes, the latency increases, but the latency is still lower than 200ms in most locations. Thanks to our global content delivery network (CDN) provided by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

In a another test, we tested the speed of our serverless storage using [Bunny CDN Tool](https://bunny.net/).

<Info>Benchmarks are not guaranteed. Remember that the latency and throughput may vary depending on your location, file size, and network conditions.</Info>
<Warning>The **latency in Africa and some locations in Asia is higher**. We are working to improve the latency in these locations as soon as possible.</Warning>
