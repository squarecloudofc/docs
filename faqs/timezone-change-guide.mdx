## Introduction

The Square Cloud servers are located in Tampa, Florida, USA. By default, the timezone is set according to this location. However, in this article, we will teach you how you can customize the timezone of your application to whichever you desire.

## Getting Started

The following sections provide code examples for both Javascript and Python:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Javascript">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Native">
        ```javascript index.js
        // Create a Date object
        const date = new Date();
        // Convert the date to a string using a specific timezone
        const dateString = date.toLocaleString("pt-BR", {
          timeZone: "America/Sao_Paulo",
        });
        console.log(dateString); // Outputs the date and time in the "America/Sao_Paulo" timezone
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Moment">
        ```javascript index.js
        const moment = require('moment');
        require('moment-timezone');

        // Create a Moment.js object with the current date and time
        const date = moment();

        // Change the timezone to "America/Sao_Paulo"
        const time = date.tz('America/Sao_Paulo');

        // Format the date/time string as needed
        // Explanation of the format string:
        // YYYY: Represents the year with four digits (e.g., 2022)
        // MM: Represents the month as a zero-padded decimal number (e.g., 01 for January, 02 for February, ..., 12 for December)
        // DD: Represents the day of the month as a zero-padded decimal number (e.g., 01, 02, ..., 31)
        // HH: Represents the hour as a zero-padded decimal number in 24-hour clock format (e.g., 00 for midnight, 13 for 1 PM, ..., 23 for 11 PM)
        // mm: Represents the minute as a zero-padded decimal number (e.g., 00, 01, ..., 59)
        // ss: Represents the second as a zero-padded decimal number (e.g., 00, 01, ..., 59)
        const formattedTime = time.format('YYYY-DD-MM HH:mm:ss');
        console.log(formattedTime); // Outputs the date and time in the "America/Sao_Paulo" timezone
        ```
