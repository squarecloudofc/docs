A **Square Cloud exclusive technology**, Auto Restart is a powerful feature in Square Cloud that allows your application to **automatically restart in case it crashes**. This ensures that **your app** remains **accessible and functional** even in the **event of unexpected failures**.

## Enabling Auto Restart
With Auto Restart, follow these steps to enable it in your application's configuration file:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Config file">
        Create or edit your `squarecloud.app` or `squarecloud.config` file.
        <Card
          title="How to create a configuration file"
          href="/getting-started/config-file"
        >
    The squarecloud.app file is a configuration file that will be used to configure your application; it will be used to define the name, description, version, main file, among other things.
</Card> 
    </Step>
    <Step title="Locate parameter">
        Locate the `AUTORESTART` parameter in the configuration file. Or add it if it doesn't exist.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Set value">
        Set the value of `AUTORESTART` to `true`.

        Here's an example of how to enable Auto Restart in your configuration file:

        ```systemd squarecloud.app OR squarecloud.config
        AUTORESTART=true
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

## How Auto Restart Works
Auto Restart is a proactive feature that monitors the health of your application. If your application crashes or becomes unresponsive, Auto Restart takes action to get it back up and running.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Application goes down">
        When your application crashes or becomes unresponsive, Auto Restart detects the issue if AUTORESTART is enabled in your configuration file.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Application Exit Status Verification">
        If the **application exit status is 1**, will proceed to next step.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Application Recent Restart Verification">
       If the **application didn't restart in the last 60 minutes**, will proceed to next step.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Application Exception Verification">
        If the application logs contain any of the excluded errors, Auto Restart will not restart the application.

        Examples of excluded errors include:
        <CodeGroup>
        ```json SyntaxError
        SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'X'..
        SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier 'X'..
        SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token 'X'..
        ```
        ```json Version didn't find
        npm ERR! notarget No matching version found for
        ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement
        And variations of this error.
        ```
        ```json Module not found
        Error: Cannot find module 'X'
        Module not found: Can't resolve 'X' in 'Y'
        And variations of this error.
        ```
        ```json Invalid dependency file
        ERROR: Invalid requirement: 'X'
        ERROR: Could not open requirements file: 'X'
        npm ERR! code EJSONPARSE... npm ERR! Failed to parse json
        And variations of this error.
        ```
        </CodeGroup>

        If the application logs contain any of these errors, Auto Restart will not restart the application.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Application Restart">
        AUTORESTART automatically restarts your application to bring it back. 😉
        <Info>Cooldown between restarts is 60 minutes.</Info>
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

Here are some best practices to make the most of Auto Restart:

-  Regularly review your application's logs to understand the reasons for any crashes or restarts. This can help you identify and address underlying issues.
- Keep your MAIN file and memory allocation parameters up-to-date to ensure optimal performance and resource usage.

## Conclusion

Auto Restart in Square Cloud is a valuable feature that enhances the reliability of your application. By automatically handling crashes and unresponsiveness, it helps maintain a seamless user experience. Ensure that you have a plan with Auto Restart enabled and configure it in your `squarecloud.app` or `squarecloud.config` file to make the most of this feature.
