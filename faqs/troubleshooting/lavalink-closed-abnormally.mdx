description: "Due to recent Lavalink updates you may come across the following error: Lavalink Closed Abnormally. This article will help you solve this issue."
---

## When does it occur?
When you are trying to connect your Lavalink server to your app hosted on Square Cloud, you may come across the following error:

```
Error: Unexpected server response: 400
Error: WebSocket closed abnormally with code 1006.
```

## Why does it occur?
You will receive this error if you are using a Lavalink version that is not compatible with the library you are using.
For example, if you are using the Lavalink version 4.0.0, you will receive this error if you are using the Lavalink client version 3, as the Lavalink version 4 is entirely REST.

## How to fix
To fix this error, you will need to update your Lavalink client to the latest version. Or use a Lavalink version that is compatible with your Lavalink client.

### Bonus Tips:
- Remember to open your Lavalink server in port 80.
- Connect in your Lavalink server using port 443 and option `secure: true`.

Congratulations! You have successfully solved the Lavalink Closed Abnormally issue. Now you can connect your Lavalink to your app hosted on Square Cloud.
