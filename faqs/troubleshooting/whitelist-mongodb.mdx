description: "Due to how Square works in a way that has a dynamic IP, by an exclusive technology, it is impossible to provide you with an IP, since every restart in the application, you receive a unique IP."
---

**Square Cloud** stands out with its **dynamic IP allocation**, assigning a **unique address** with **each application restart**. Unlike static IPs, this dynamic approach enhances security by constantly changing the network footprint, **making it more resilient against potential threats**. 

## When does it occur?
When you are trying to connect your MongoDB Atlas database to your app hosted on Square Cloud, you may come across the following error:

```
MongoNetworkError: connection 0 to shard-xxx-xxx.mongodb.net:27017 closed
```

## Why does it occur?
You will receive this error message if you have not included the MongoDB Atlas addresses, the IP where your app is hosted, on the whitelist.

## How to fix
To fix this error, you need to whitelist the IP address, according to the [mongodb documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security/ip-access-list/), you need to whitelist 0.0.0.0/0 IP address.

Congratulations! You have successfully whitelisted the IP address 0.0.0.0/0 for your MongoDB Atlas database. Now you can connect your database to your app hosted on Square Cloud.
