## When does it occur?

This issue occurs when your application is using more RAM than is available.

```bash
[SQUARE-SHIELD] LACK_OF_RAM
```

## Why does it occur?

This issue occurs when your application is using more RAM than is available. This can happen when your application is using more RAM than is available on your current plan.

## How to fix

Navigate to the file manager and locate the `squarecloud.app/config` file.
1. Open the file and locate the `MEMORY` field.
2. Increase the value of the `MEMORY` field. The value is in megabytes (MB). 
3. We recommend increasing the value by 50% of the current value. For example, if the current value is `512`, increase it to `768`.

If you are already using the maximum available RAM based on your current plan, consider upgrading to a higher plan by visiting the [plans page](https://squarecloud.app/plans).
