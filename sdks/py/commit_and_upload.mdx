You can make commits and uploads using Client or Application. You
just need a `squarecloud.File` object and pass the path where your
zip file is.

## Making a commit

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Using Client">
    ```python
    import squarecloud as square

    client = square.Client('API_KEY')

    async def example():
        file = square.File('path/to/you/file.zip')
        await client.commit(file=file, app_id='application_id')
    ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Using Application">
    ```python
    import squarecloud as square

    client = square.Client('API_KEY')

    async def example():
        app = await client.app(app_id='application_id')
        file = square.File('path/to/you/file.zip')
        await app.commit(file=file)
    ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Making a upload

To upload an application, you only use the [Client] and the CLI.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Using Client">
    ```python
    import squarecloud as square

    client = square.Client(...)

    async def example():
        file = square.File('path/to/you/file.zip')
        await client.upload_app(file=file)
    ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Remember that to upload an application you need a zip that contains (at least) the following files:**:

- Main file: responsible for starting your application
- Dependencies file: contains information about which dependencies are necessary
- Configuration file (squarecloud.app): a configuration file specifying the
name,
description, main file name, version, etc. To learn more about the
configuration file, take a look at this [guide](https://docs.squarecloud.app/getting-started/config-file).

<Tip>
    For your convenience, a class has been added to create this configuration file:
    `squarecloud.utils.ConfigFile`.
