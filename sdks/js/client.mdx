## Parameters

### API Key

- Type: `string`
- Required: Yes
- Description: A valid API key must be provided as a string for authentication.

## Get Started

Using the get started endpoint, you can obtain a user object representing the user associated with the API key, as well as a list of applications associated with the user.

```javascript 
const user = await api.user.get();

console.log(user.applications); // List of Application's
```

## Application

Using the `Client`, you can obtain an object representing your application. This object is an instance of the `Application` class, allowing you to manage your application more conveniently without always needing to pass the ID.

```javascript Obtaining an Application
const app = user.applications.get("Application ID");
console.log(app); // Output: application object
```

```javascript Obtaining All Applications
console.log(user.applications); // user = api.user.get() [Promise]
```
