<Steps>
    <Step title="Get API key">
        First you need to get an API key from the [Developer Dashboard](https://squarecloud.app/account). You can use this API key to authenticate to the Square Cloud CLI.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Authenticate">
        Authenticate to the Square Cloud CLI using the following command:
        ```bash
        squarecloud auth login
        ```

        You will be prompted to enter your API key.
        ```bash
        Your API Token:
        > Insert your square cloud api token
        ```

        After entering your API key, you will be authenticated to the Square Cloud CLI.

        You can skip the prompt by passing your API key with the `--token` flag:
        ```bash
        squarecloud auth login --token=<API key>
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>
