## Upload your project 😁
You can upload your project to Square Cloud in a few simple steps, as shown below:

<Steps>
  <Step title="First, read the instructions about your language:">
    <Snippet file="languages.mdx" />
    <Info>For this example, we will use the JavaScript (Node.js) language.</Info>
  </Step>
    <Step title="After, create your Square Cloud config file.">
    After accessing the dashboard, you need to create a configuration file. You can create a [configuration file](/getting-started/config-file) reading this article [here](/getting-started/config-file).
 
    ```systemd Example of a config file for a bot
    MAIN=index.js
    MEMORY=512
    VERSION=recommended
    DISPLAY_NAME=Batman bot
    DESCRIPTION=This bot is the dark knight of the night.
    ```

    ```systemd Example of a config file for a web application. (Url configured to be "batman.squareweb.app")
    MAIN=index.js
    MEMORY=512
    VERSION=recommended
    SUBDOMAIN=batman
    START=npm run build && npm run start
    DISPLAY_NAME=Batman website
    DESCRIPTION=This website is the dark knight of the night.
    ```
  </Step>
