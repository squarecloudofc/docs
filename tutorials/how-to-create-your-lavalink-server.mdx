## Choosing the Version

Choose your desired version of `Lavalink` by clicking [here](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink/releases/). We recommend selecting the latest version for the best experience.

## Creating the squarecloud config file

<Card title="Learn about: how to make the configuration file for Square Cloud." icon="link" href="https://docs.squarecloud.app/getting-started/config-file">
The squarecloud.app file is a configuration file that will be used to configure your application; it will be used to define the name, description, version, main file, among other things.
</Card>

## Creating the application.yml

Create a configuration file for your Lavalink server. You can access an example file [here](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink/blob/master/LavalinkServer/application.yml.example).

<Warning>Set the `port` field in your `application.yml` file to: `80`.</Warning>

## Enhancing Security

It is highly recommended to configure a secure password in the `password` field of your configuration file (application.yml). We recommend using a password with at least 32 characters.

<Note>It is important to remember that you must use port 443 (SSL) and the `secure` option in `true` to connect to your lavalink.</Note>

## Uploading Project to Square Cloud

Create a compressed file (.zip) containing the `Lavalink.jar` and `application.yml`. Then, upload your configuration file to Square Cloud.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="First Step">
        First, you need to have the CLI installed in your environment. If you
        don't have it yet, run the following command in your terminal:
        ```
        npm install -g @squarecloud/cli
        ```
        If you already have it, we recommend updating it. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:
        <Tabs>
          <Tab title="Windows">
            ```bash
            squarecloud update
            ```
          </Tab>
          <Tab title="Linux, macOS, and WSL">
            ```bash
            curl -fsSL https://cli.squarecloud.app/install | bash

          </Tab>
        </Tabs>

        authorization key [here](https://squarecloud.app/dashboard/settings) by clicking on
        "Request API Key". After obtaining your authorization key, run the
        following command: 
        ```bash
