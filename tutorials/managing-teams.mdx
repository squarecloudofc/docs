## Introduction

- Before you start, you will need to create an account on Square Cloud, which can be done through the [sign up page](https://squarecloud.app/signup). You can use your email to create an account.
- Finally, you need to have a paid plan active on your account. You can view our plans and purchase one [here](https://squarecloud.app/pricing).

## Creating Your Team

To create your team, you should go to the [dashboard](https://squarecloud.app/dashboard), click on your profile and choose the "Create a Team" option. Finally, just choose the name of your team and confirm. Thus, it will be created and you can access it by selecting your profile again and choosing the desired team.
