## Introduction

- Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. If you don't have them yet, you can download them from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
- Next, you will need to create an account on Square Cloud, which can be done through the [sign up page](https://squarecloud.app/signup). You can use your email to create an account.
- Finally, you need to have an active paid plan on your account. You can view our plans and purchase one according to your needs [here](https://squarecloud.app/plans).

### Setting up NestJS CLI

To use the NestJS command-line interface (CLI), you need to install it globally on your system. Run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @nestjs/cli
```

This command installs the `@nestjs/cli` package globally on your system, which allows you to use the `nest` command from anywhere in your terminal.

### Creating a NestJS Project

To create a new NestJS project, run the following command:

```bash
nest new my-app
```

In this command, `nest new my-app` is used to create a new NestJS project. The `nest new` command is a tool that comes with `nest`, the NestJS CLI (Command Line Interface). It is used to initialize a new NestJS application.

`my-app` is the name of the new application. This command creates a new directory named `my-app` and sets up the necessary files and dependencies for a basic NestJS application.

## Configuring Port 80

After generating the NestJS project with the command `nest new my-app`, the file you need to modify to change the port is `main.ts`. This file is located at the root of your project directory, inside the `src` folder.

```typescript
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  await app.listen(80); // Change the port number here to 80
}
bootstrap();
```
Port 80 is the default port for HTTP traffic.

## Building the Application

NestJS uses TypeScript, so you could compile your TypeScript code to JavaScript before you can run your application.

You can build your application by running the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command runs the `build` script defined in your `package.json` file, which in turn runs the `nest build` command. This command compiles your TypeScript code to JavaScript.

## Creating the squarecloud config file

<Card title="Learn about: how to make the configuration file for Square Cloud." icon="link" href="https://docs.squarecloud.app/getting-started/config-file">
The squarecloud.app file is a configuration file that will be used to configure your application; it will be used to define the name, description, version, main file, among other things.
</Card>

## Configuring the MAIN field

You need to specify the main file of your application in the `MAIN` field of squarecloud.app. For a NestJS application, the main file is the compiled JavaScript file of your `main.ts` file, which is `dist/main.js`.

Here's how you can set it:

```app squarecloud.app
MAIN=dist/main.js
```

## Configuring the START Field

In the Square Cloud configuration file, the **START** field is optional and is only necessary if you are using a custom script to start the website or API. In the example provided, the **START** field is not necessary.

## Purchasing a Plan Before Uploading Your Project

Before you can upload your project to Square Cloud, it's important to understand that you need to purchase a plan. The type of plan you choose will depend on the resources required by your application. You can view our plans [here](https://squarecloud.app/plans).

<Note>**Are you wondering how much RAM and CPU your plan needs to host a NestJS application?** Don't worry, we're here to help. NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications. It's modular, testable, and strongly typed with TypeScript, making it a great choice for complex back-end development. Our **[Standard](https://squarecloud.app/pay/standard)** plan offers **4GB** of RAM and **4vCPU**, which should be sufficient for most Nestjs applications. However, if you're working on a larger project or need more stability, we recommend considering our Pro plan. With additional resources, you can ensure smooth performance even under high demand. To purchase, simply click [here](https://squarecloud.app/pay/pro).</Note>

## Uploading Project to Square Cloud

After preparing your project files, you can now upload them to Square Cloud and host your project.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard Upload">
    Access the [Square Cloud
    Dashboard](https://squarecloud.app/dashboard/upload) and upload your project
    files.

    </Frame>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="CLI Upload">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="First Step">
        First, you need to have the CLI installed in your environment. If you
        don't have it yet, run the following command in your terminal:
        ```
        npm install -g @squarecloud/cli
        ```
        If you already have it, we recommend updating it. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:
        <Tabs>
          <Tab title="Windows">
            ```bash
            squarecloud update
            ```
          </Tab>
          <Tab title="Linux, macOS, and WSL">
            ```bash
            curl -fsSL https://cli.squarecloud.app/install | bash
            ```
          </Tab>
        </Tabs>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Second Step">
        Now, to authenticate and use other CLI commands, you will find your
        authorization key [here](https://squarecloud.app/account) by clicking on
        "Request API Key". After obtaining your authorization key, run the
        following command: 
        ```bash 
        squarecloud login
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Third Step">
        Finally, to deploy your application to Square Cloud using the CLI, you
        need to execute the following command, passing the path of your zip
        file: 
        ```bash 
        squarecloud upload zip
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Custom Domain" icon="globe" iconType="solid">
    If you want to use a custom domain for your app hosted on Square Cloud, note that by default, the URL will be something like `https://mysite.squareweb.app/`. The subdomain is determined by the SUBDOMAIN field in the configuration file. However, if you prefer using a custom domain, such as `mysite.com`, you'll need to purchase the `Standard` plan or a higher plan. We detail each step to set up your custom domain in our article: [How to set up your custom domain](https://docs.squarecloud.app/tutorials/how-to-set-up-your-domain).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Minimum RAM Requirements" icon="memory" iconType="solid">
    The minimum amount of RAM required to host a website or API is 512MB. However, depending on the size and complexity of your NestJS application, it may be advisable to use a larger amount of RAM to avoid the [LACK_OF_RAM](https://docs.squarecloud.app/faqs/troubleshooting/LACK_OF_RAM) error.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Temporarily Denied Access" icon="ban" iconType="solid">
    If you receive the message "Your access has been temporarily denied." when trying to access the site, wait for some time. If the issue persists, feel free to contact us at https://squarecloud.app/dashboard/support.
