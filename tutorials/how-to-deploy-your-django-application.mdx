## Creating a New Django Project

- Before getting started, make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system. If you don't already have them, you can download them from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/) and [official Pip website](https://pypi.org/).
- Next, you will need to create an account on Square Cloud, which can be done through the [login page](https://squarecloud.app/login). You can use either your email or Discord, or both, to create an account.
- Finally, you need to have an active paid plan on your account. You can view our plans and purchase one according to your needs [here](https://squarecloud.app/plans).

With Python and pip installed, you can create a new Django project. First, install Django using pip:

```bash
pip install django
```

Then, create a new Python file (e.g., `app.py`) and add the following code to create a basic Django application:

```python app.py
from django.conf import settings
from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.urls import path
from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application

# Basic Django settings
settings.configure(
    DEBUG=False,  # Turn off debug mode
    SECRET_KEY='mysecretkey',  # Set your secret key
    ALLOWED_HOSTS=['*'],  # Allow all hosts for simplicity
    ROOT_URLCONF=__name__,  # Set the root URL configuration to this module
    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES=(),  # Use an empty tuple to disable middleware
)

# Simple view
def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello world!")  # Return a simple HTTP response

# URL configuration
urlpatterns = [
    path('', index),  # Map the root URL to the index view
]

# WSGI application
application = get_wsgi_application()

# WSGI server
if __name__ == "__main__":
    from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server
    httpd = make_server('', 80, application)  # Serve the application using the WSGI server on port 80
    print("Django server running on port 80...")
    httpd.serve_forever()  # Start the server
```

In the above code, we create a basic route that returns "Hello, World!" when accessed. The application is configured to run on port 80, which is the default port for HTTP traffic.

## Managing Dependencies with the requirements.txt file

The `requirements.txt` file is a file that lists all external libraries required for your project. You should list all libraries your project will use, excluding native libraries like `random` and `datetime`. This file should be included when submitting your application to Square Cloud.

```txt requirements.txt
django
```

## Creating the squarecloud config file

<Card title="Learn about: how to make the configuration file for Square Cloud." icon="link" href="https://docs.squarecloud.app/getting-started/config-file">
The squarecloud.app file is a configuration file that will be used to configure your application; it will be used to define the name, description, version, main file, among other things.
</Card>

## Configuring the START Field

In the Square Cloud configuration file, the **START** field is optional and is only necessary if you are using a custom script to start the website. In the example provided, the **START** field is not necessary.

## Purchasing a Plan Before Uploading Your Project

Before you can upload your project to Square Cloud, it's important to understand that you need to purchase a plan. The type of plan you choose will depend on the resources required by your application. You can view our plans [here](https://squarecloud.app/plans).

<Note>**Are you wondering how much RAM and CPU your plan needs to host a Django application?** Don't worry, we're here to help. Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It's built by experienced developers and takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Our **[Standard](https://squarecloud.app/pay/standard)** plan offers **4GB** of RAM and **1vCPU**, which should be sufficient for most Django applications. However, if you're working on a larger project and seeking extra stability, we recommend considering our Pro plan. With additional resources, you can maintain stability even during peak demand. To purchase, simply click [here](https://squarecloud.app/pay/pro).</Note>

## Uploading Project to Square Cloud

After preparing your project files, you can now upload them to Square Cloud and host your project.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard Upload">
    Access the [Square Cloud
    Dashboard](https://squarecloud.app/dashboard/upload) and upload your project
    files.

    </Frame>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="CLI Upload">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="First Step">
        First, you need to have the CLI installed in your environment. If you
        don't have it yet, run the following command in your terminal:
        ```
        npm install -g @squarecloud/cli
        ```
        If you already have it, we recommend updating it. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:
        <Tabs>
          <Tab title="Windows">
            ```bash
            squarecloud update
            ```
          </Tab>
          <Tab title="Linux, macOS, and WSL">
            ```bash
            curl -fsSL https://cli.squarecloud.app/install | bash
            ```
          </Tab>
        </Tabs>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Second Step">
        Now, to authenticate and use other CLI commands, you will find your
        authorization key [here](https://squarecloud.app/dashboard/settings) by clicking on
        "Request API Key". After obtaining your authorization key, run the
        following command: 
        ```bash 
        squarecloud login
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Third Step">
        Finally, to deploy your application to Square Cloud using the CLI, you
        need to execute the following command, passing the path of your zip
        file: 
        ```bash 
        squarecloud upload zip
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Custom Domain" icon="globe" iconType="solid">
    If you want to use a custom domain for your application hosted on Square Cloud, note that by default, the URL will be something like `https://mysite.squareweb.app/`. The subdomain is determined by the SUBDOMAIN field in the configuration file. However, if you prefer to use a custom domain, such as `mysite.com`, you'll need to purchase the `Standard` plan or a higher plan. We detail each step to set up your custom domain in our article: [How to Set Up Your Custom Domain](https://docs.squarecloud.app/tutorials/how-to-set-up-your-domain).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Minimum RAM Requirements" icon="memory" iconType="solid">
    The minimum amount of RAM required to host a website or API is 512MB. However, depending on the size and complexity of your Django application, it may be advisable to use a larger amount of RAM to avoid the [LACK_OF_RAM](https://docs.squarecloud.app/faqs/troubleshooting/LACK_OF_RAM) error.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Temporary Access Denied" icon="ban" iconType="solid">
    If you receive the message "Your access has been temporarily denied." when trying to access the site, please wait for some time. If the issue persists, feel free to contact us at https://squarecloud.app/dashboard/support.

    <Accordion title="Website took too long to respond..." icon="clock" iconType="solid">
     If you receive the message "Website took too long to respond..." make sure you have correctly set port 80 on your application. If the issue persists, feel free to contact us at https://squarecloud.app/dashboard/support.
