## Introduction

- Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. If you don't have them yet, you can download them from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
- Next, you will need to create an account on Square Cloud, which can be done through the [login page](https://squarecloud.app/login). You can use either your email or Discord, or both, to create an account.
- Finally, you need to have an active paid plan on your account. You can view our plans and purchase one according to your needs [here](https://squarecloud.app/plans).

### Setting up Fastify

To use Fastify, you need to install it on your system. Run the following command:

```bash
npm install fastify
```

This command installs the `fastify` package on your system, which allows you to use Fastify in your terminal.

### Creating a Fastify Project

To create a new Fastify project, you can start by creating a new file and writing the following code:

```javascript app.js
// Importing the Fastify module
const fastify = require('fastify')({ logger: true });

// Defining a route handler for the route '/'
// This route handler sends 'Hello, World!' when accessed.
fastify.get('/', async (request, reply) => {
  return 'Hello World!';
});

// Making our Fastify application listen on port 80
fastify.listen({ port: 80 })
  .then((address) => {
    // This block of code will run once the server is listening on port 80
    fastify.log.info(`Example app listening at ${address}`);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    // This block of code will run if there is an error when trying to listen on port 80
    fastify.log.error(err);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```
## Creating the squarecloud config file

<Card title="Learn about: how to make the configuration file for Square Cloud." icon="link" href="https://docs.squarecloud.app/getting-started/config-file">
The squarecloud.app file is a configuration file that will be used to configure your application; it will be used to define the name, description, version, main file, among other things.
</Card>

## Configuring the START Field

In the Square Cloud configuration file, the **START** field is optional and is only necessary if you are using a custom script to start the website or API. In the example provided, the **START** field is not necessary.

## Purchasing a Plan Before Uploading Your Project

Before you can upload your project to Square Cloud, it's important to understand that you need to purchase a plan. The type of plan you choose will depend on the resources required by your application. You can view our plans [here](https://squarecloud.app/plans).

<Note>**Are you wondering how much RAM and CPU your plan needs to host a Fastify application?** Don't worry, we're here to help. Fastify is a web framework highly focused on providing the best developer experience with the least overhead and a powerful plugin architecture. It's easy to learn, highly flexible, and suitable for a wide range of applications, making it a great choice for web development. Fastify also has excellent production capabilities, making it a robust choice for building and deploying production-grade applications. It's designed to be efficient, fast, and lightweight, ensuring your applications run smoothly and reliably. Our **[Standard](https://squarecloud.app/pay/standard)** plan offers **4GB** of RAM and **1vCPU**, which should be sufficient for most Fastify applications. However, if you're working on a larger project or need more stability, we recommend considering our Pro plan. With additional resources, you can ensure smooth performance even under high demand. To purchase, simply click [here](https://squarecloud.app/pay/pro).</Note>

## Uploading Project to Square Cloud

After preparing your project files, you can now upload them to Square Cloud and host your project.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard Upload">
    Access the [Square Cloud
    Dashboard](https://squarecloud.app/dashboard/upload) and upload your project
    files.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/uploading.gif" style={{ borderRadius: "0.2rem" }} />
    </Frame>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="CLI Upload">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="First Step">
        First, you need to have the CLI installed in your environment. If you
        don't have it yet, run the following command in your terminal:
        ```
        npm install -g @squarecloud/cli
        ```
        If you already have it, we recommend updating it. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:
        <Tabs>
          <Tab title="Windows">
            ```bash
            squarecloud update
            ```
          </Tab>
          <Tab title="Linux, macOS, and WSL">
            ```bash
            curl -fsSL https://cli.squarecloud.app/install | bash
            ```
          </Tab>
        </Tabs>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Second Step">
        Now, to authenticate and use other CLI commands, you will find your
        authorization key [here](https://squarecloud.app/account) by clicking on
        "Request API Key". After obtaining your authorization key, run the
        following command: 
        ```bash 
        squarecloud login
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Third Step">
        Finally, to deploy your application to Square Cloud using the CLI, you
        need to execute the following command, passing the path of your zip
        file: 
        ```bash 
        squarecloud upload zip
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Custom Domain" icon="globe" iconType="solid">
   If you want to use a custom domain for your application hosted on Square Cloud, note that by default, the URL will be something like `https://mysite.squareweb.app/`. The subdomain is determined by the SUBDOMAIN field in the configuration file. However, if you prefer using a custom domain, such as `mysite.com`, you'll need to purchase the `Standard` plan or a higher plan. We detail each step to set up your custom domain in our article: [How to set up your custom domain](https://docs.squarecloud.app/tutorials/how-to-set-up-your-domain).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Minimum RAM Requirements" icon="memory" iconType="solid">
    The minimum amount of RAM required to host a website or API is 512MB. However, depending on the size and complexity of your Fastify application, it may be advisable to use a larger amount of RAM to avoid the [LACK_OF_RAM](https://docs.squarecloud.app/faqs/troubleshooting/LACK_OF_RAM) error.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Temporarily Denied Access" icon="ban" iconType="solid">
    If you receive the message "Your access has been temporarily denied." when trying to access the site, wait for some time. If the issue persists, feel free to contact us at https://squarecloud.app/support.

  <Accordion title="Website took too long to respond..." icon="clock" iconType="solid">
     If you receive the message "Website took too long to respond..." make sure you have correctly set port 80 on your application. If the issue persists, feel free to contact us at https://squarecloud.app/support.
