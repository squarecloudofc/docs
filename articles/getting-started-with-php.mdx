## Introduction 🚀

- Before you begin, make sure you have PHP on your system. If you don't have them yet, you can download them from the [official PHP website](https://www.php.net/).
- Next, you will need to create an account on Square Cloud, which can be done through the [login page](https://squarecloud.app/login). You can use either your email or Discord, or both, to create an account.
- Finally, you need to have an active paid plan on your account. You can view our plans and purchase one according to your needs [here](https://squarecloud.app/plans).

## Creating the squarecloud config file ⚙️

  The squarecloud.app file is a configuration file that will be used to
  configure your application; it will be used to define the name, description,
  version, main file, among other things.

### Required Files 📄
Make sure your project includes the following files:

- index.php (Example of main file).
- `composer.json` (*optional dependency file).
- [squarecloud.app](/getting-started/config-file) (a file containing your Square Cloud configuration).

## Preparing Project for Upload 🚀

Before you can host your project on Square Cloud, ensure your project files are correctly configured for hosting.

If your project includes a `composer.json` file, Square Cloud will automatically install dependencies using Composer. However, if your project also has Node dependencies (i.e., a `package.json` file), you should specify the installation process in the `START` field of your `squarecloud.app` file. For example:

```plaintext
START=npm install && php .....
```
If your project lacks a `composer.json` file, it will be initialized by executing the following command: `php -S 0.0.0.0:80`, which will start a web server.

<Warning>The configuration (`squarecloud.app/.config`) file must be located in the root of the zip file. Otherwise, Square Cloud will not be able to find it during deployment.</Warning>

## Uploading Project to Square Cloud 📤

After preparing your project files, you can now upload them to Square Cloud and host your project.

  <Tab title="CLI Upload">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="First Step">
        First, you need to have the CLI installed in your environment. If you
        don't have it yet, run the following command in your terminal: ```npm install -g @squarecloud/cli``` If you already have it, we
        recommend updating it. To do this, run the following command in your
        terminal: 
        ```bash 
        squarecloud update
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Second Step">
        Now, to authenticate and use other CLI commands, you will find your
        authorization key [here](https://squarecloud.app/account) by clicking on
        "Request API Key". After obtaining your authorization key, run the
        following command: 
        ```bash 
        squarecloud login
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Third Step">
        Finally, to deploy your application to Square Cloud using the CLI, you
        need to execute the following command, passing the path of your zip
        file: 
        ```bash 
        squarecloud upload app.zip
        ```
      </Step>
