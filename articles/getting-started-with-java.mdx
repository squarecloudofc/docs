## 🚀 Introduction

- Before you begin, make sure you have Java on your system. If you don't have them yet, you can download them from the [official Java website](https://www.java.com/download/manual.jsp).
- Next, you will need to create an account on Square Cloud, which can be done through the [login page](https://squarecloud.app/login). You can use either your email or Discord, or both, to create an account.
- Finally, you need to have an active paid plan on your account. You can view our plans and purchase one according to your needs [here](https://squarecloud.app/plans).

## ⚙️ Creating the squarecloud config file

<Card
  title="Learn about: how to make the configuration file for Square Cloud."
  icon="link"
  href="https://docs.squarecloud.app/getting-started/config-file"
>
  The squarecloud.app file is a configuration file that will be used to
  configure your application; it will be used to define the name, description,
  version, main file, among other things.
</Card>

## 📄 Required Files
- project.jar (Example of main file).
- MANIFEST.MF (Dependency file).
- [squarecloud.app](/getting-started/config-file) (file that contains the Square Cloud configuration).

## ▶️ Start Application

- If the `START` field is not defined in the configuration file, Square Cloud will run `java -jar MAIN`, where the file specified in the `MAIN` field is the `JAR` file. If the `START` field is defined in the configuration file, the value in the `START` field will be executed directly. For more information on configuration file parameters, visit [configuration parameters](https://docs.squarecloud.app/getting-started/config-file#configuration-parameters).

## 🖥️ Preparing Project for Upload

Before hosting your project on Square Cloud, you must first have the files of your project properly configured, so that you can host it later.

<Warning>The configuration (`squarecloud.app/.config`) file must be located in the root of the zip file. Otherwise, Square Cloud will not be able to find it during deployment.</Warning>

## 📤 Uploading Project to Square Cloud

After preparing your project files, you can now upload them to Square Cloud and host your project.

  <Tab title="CLI Upload">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="First Step">
        First, you need to have the CLI installed in your environment. If you
        don't have it yet, run the following command in your terminal:
        ```
        npm install -g @squarecloud/cli
        ```
        If you already have it, we recommend updating it. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:
        <Tabs>
          <Tab title="Windows">
            ```bash
            squarecloud update
            ```
          </Tab>
          <Tab title="Linux, macOS, and WSL">
            ```bash
            curl -fsSL https://cli.squarecloud.app/install | bash
            ```
          </Tab>
        </Tabs>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Second Step">
        Now, to authenticate and use other CLI commands, you will find your
        authorization key [here](https://squarecloud.app/account) by clicking on
        "Request API Key". After obtaining your authorization key, run the
        following command: 
        ```bash 
        squarecloud login
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Third Step">
        Finally, to deploy your application to Square Cloud using the CLI, you
        need to execute the following command, passing the path of your zip
        file: 
        ```bash 
        squarecloud upload zip
        ```
      </Step>
