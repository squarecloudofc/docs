## 🚀 Introduction

- Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. If you don't have them yet, you can download them from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
- Next, you will need to create an account on Square Cloud, which can be done through the [login page](https://squarecloud.app/login). You can use either your email or Discord, or both, to create an account.
- Finally, you need to have an active paid plan on your account. You can view our plans and purchase one according to your needs [here](https://squarecloud.app/plans).

## ⚙️ Creating the squarecloud config file

<Card
  title="Learn about: how to make the configuration file for Square Cloud."
  icon="link"
  href="https://docs.squarecloud.app/getting-started/config-file"
>
  The squarecloud.app file is a configuration file that will be used to
  configure your application; it will be used to define the name, description,
  version, main file, among other things.
</Card>

## ▶️ Start Application

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Javascript">
    - If the `START` field is not defined in the configuration file, Square Cloud will by default run `node` with optimization options and specific parameters. If the `START` field is defined in the configuration file, the value in the `START` field will be executed directly. For more information on configuration file parameters, visit [configuration parameters](https://docs.squarecloud.app/getting-started/config-file#configuration-parameters).
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Typescript">
    - If the `START` field is not defined in the configuration file, Square Cloud will by default run `npx tsx MAIN` to compile and execute the main TypeScript file specified by `MAIN` field. If the `START` field is defined in the configuration file, the value in the `START` field will be executed directly. For more information on configuration file parameters, visit [configuration parameters](https://docs.squarecloud.app/getting-started/config-file#configuration-parameters).
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

- If the `node_modules` folder does not exist, Square Cloud will run `npm install --no-package-lock --no-audit --no-fund` to install dependencies and clean the `.npm` folder.

## 🖥️ Preparing Your Node.js Project

### 📁 Essential Configuration Files

When preparing your Node.js project for deployment on Square Cloud, ensure that you include your configuration file (`squarecloud.app/.config`) and the essential files of your application in a zip file.

<Warning>The configuration (`squarecloud.app/.config`) file must be located in the root of the zip file. Otherwise, Square Cloud will not be able to find it during deployment.</Warning>

#### 🗑️ Files to Exclude Before Uploading

- `node_modules`: This folder is not required to be sent as it will be created during the installation process in the production environment.
- `package-lock.json`: This file is not necessary because the production environment will install dependencies based on `package.json`.

### 🤔 Why Exclude These Files?

There are several reasons to exclude `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` before uploading your project:

1. **Installation Consistency:** Not sending the `node_modules` folder ensures that dependencies are installed by the production environment, resulting in a consistent build free from local system discrepancies.

2. **Updated Installations:** The production environment will install the latest compatible versions of the dependencies listed in `package.json`, providing a clean start for your application.

3. **Reduced Upload Size:** Leaving out these files decreases the size of your upload file, which speeds up the upload process and makes deployment more efficient.

By doing this, you can ensure that your Node.js application is optimally prepared and secure for deployment to Square Cloud.

### 📄 Required Files

Three files are required to host your Node project:

- [squarecloud.app/.config](/getting-started/config-file)
- mainFile.js/.ts (Example of main file)
- [package.json](./how-to-create-your-package-json.mdx) (Dependency file)

<Note>
  Square Cloud natively supports `TypeScript`, running your project through
  ts-node, but it is recommended to always compile to `JavaScript` since we are
  a production platform.
</Note>

## 💡 Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion
    title="The main file is invalid or corrupted"
    icon="file"
    iconType="solid"
  >
    This error occurs when the file defined as "main" for your application in
    the configuration file does not exist, is written incorrectly, or the path
    is incorrect. If your main file is inside a folder, for example, you should
    enter `folder/file.js`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Bad Memory" icon="memory" iconType="solid">
    The minimum amount of RAM required to host a bot is 256MB, and for a
    website/API, it's 512MB. However, depending on the size and complexity of
    your application, it may be advisable to allocate a larger amount of RAM to
    avoid the
    [LACK_OF_RAM](https://docs.squarecloud.app/faqs/troubleshooting/LACK_OF_RAM)
    error.

## 📤 Uploading Project to Square Cloud

After preparing your project files, you can now upload them to Square Cloud and host your project.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard Upload">
    Access the [Square Cloud
    Dashboard](https://squarecloud.app/dashboard/upload) and upload your project
    files.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/uploading.gif" style={{ borderRadius: "0.2rem" }} />
    </Frame>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="CLI Upload">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="First Step">
        First, you need to have the CLI installed in your environment. If you
        don't have it yet, run the following command in your terminal:
        ```
        npm install -g @squarecloud/cli
        ```
        If you already have it, we recommend updating it. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:
        <Tabs>
          <Tab title="Windows">
            ```bash
            squarecloud update
            ```
          </Tab>
          <Tab title="Linux, macOS, and WSL">
            ```bash
            curl -fsSL https://cli.squarecloud.app/install | bash
            ```
          </Tab>
        </Tabs>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Second Step">
        Now, to authenticate and use other CLI commands, you will find your
        authorization key [here](https://squarecloud.app/account) by clicking on
        "Request API Key". After obtaining your authorization key, run the
        following command: 
        ```bash 
        squarecloud login
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Third Step">
        Finally, to deploy your application to Square Cloud using the CLI, you
        need to execute the following command, passing the path of your zip
        file: 
        ```bash 
        squarecloud upload zip
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>
